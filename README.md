<h2>Forking a Repository in GitHub</h2>

<h3>What is Forking?</h3>
<p>Forking a repository in GitHub allows you to create a copy of someone else's project in your own GitHub account. This enables you to experiment, modify, and enhance the code without affecting the original repository.</p>

<h3>Why Fork a Repository?</h3>
<p>Forking is particularly useful for contributing to open-source projects. You can make changes in your forked version and later submit a <strong>pull request</strong> to propose these changes to the original project. This ensures that the main repository remains stable while allowing contributors to improve the project.</p>

<h3>How to Work with a Forked Repository?</h3>
<p>Once you fork a repository, you can <strong>clone</strong> it to your local machine using Git, modify the code, and push updates to your fork. This gives you complete control over your copy while keeping it linked to the original repository.</p>

<h3>Keeping Your Fork Updated</h3>
<p>Since the original repository may receive updates over time, you can <strong>sync your fork</strong> to stay up to date. This can be done using Git commands like <code>git fetch upstream</code> followed by <code>git merge upstream/main</code>, ensuring that your fork remains in sync with the latest changes.</p>
